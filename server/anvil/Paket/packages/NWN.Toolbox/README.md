# NWN.Toolbox

NWN.Toolbox is a plugin for Anvil-based Neverwinter Nights servers that provides the essential tools and features needed to run any type of persistent world.

It is intended as a modern replacement of the [DMFI Wands & Widgets](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/script/dmfi-wands-widgets-109) package with a focus on using newer game tools and APIs like NUI and SQLite.

### Installation
1. Download the latest plugin from the Releases page: https://github.com/Jorteck/NWN.Toolbox/releases
2. Unzip the file, and place the `NWN.Toolbox` folder into your Anvil plugin directory. The directory structure should look like the following:
```
|----Plugins/
     |----NWN.Toolbox/
          |----NWN.Toolbox.dll
```
3. Launch the server, then connect to the server as a dungeon master. The toolbox button should be immediately available!
